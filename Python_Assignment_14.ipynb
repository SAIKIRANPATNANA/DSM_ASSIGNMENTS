    "Q1. **What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of traditional table-based structures used in SQL databases. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and is highly scalable, flexible, and easily accessible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Non-relational databases:** Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that do not require a fixed schema and are not based on the traditional relational model used by SQL databases. They provide a more flexible data model, better scalability, and faster performance for certain types of applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scenarios to use MongoDB over SQL databases:**\n",
    "  - When dealing with large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "  - When the schema of the data is likely to change frequently.\n",
    "  - When high scalability and horizontal scaling are required.\n",
    "  - When fast reads and writes are necessary, especially for applications with real-time requirements.\n",
    "  - When handling data that does not fit well into the tabular structure of SQL databases, such as hierarchical or nested data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **State and Explain the features of MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flexible schema:** MongoDB allows flexible schemas, enabling documents in a collection to have different structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:** MongoDB is designed to scale out horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers, enabling seamless handling of large datasets and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High availability:** MongoDB provides built-in support for replication and automatic failover, ensuring high availability and data durability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rich query language:** MongoDB supports a powerful query language with support for rich queries, including field, range, and logical operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing:** MongoDB supports indexing for efficient querying and sorting of data, improving query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Aggregation:** MongoDB provides aggregation pipelines for performing complex data aggregation operations, such as grouping, sorting, and transforming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Geospatial indexing:** MongoDB supports geospatial indexing and queries, making it suitable for location-based applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GridFS:** MongoDB includes GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files, such as images and videos, in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **Write a code to connect MongoDB to Python. Also, create a database and a collection in MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pymongo\n",
    "\n",
    "# Connect to MongoDB\n",
    "myclient = pymongo.MongoClient(\"mongodb://localhost:27017/\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create database\n",
    "mydb = myclient[\"mydatabase\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create collection\n",
    "mycol = mydb[\"customers\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Using the database and the collection created in question number 3, write a code to insert one record, and insert many records. Use the find() and find_one() methods to print the inserted record.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Insert one record\n",
    "mydict = { \"name\": \"John\", \"address\": \"Highway 37\" }\n",
    "x = mycol.insert_one(mydict)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x.inserted_id)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Insert many records\n",
    "mylist = [\n",
    "  { \"name\": \"Amy\", \"address\": \"Apple st 652\"},\n",
    "  { \"name\": \"Hannah\", \"address\": \"Mountain 21\"},\n",
    "  { \"name\": \"Michael\", \"address\": \"Valley 345\"},\n",
    "  { \"name\": \"Sandy\", \"address\": \"Ocean blvd 2\"},\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "x = mycol.insert_many(mylist)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(x.inserted_ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find one record\n",
    "x = mycol.find_one()\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Find all records\n",
    "for x in mycol.find():\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Explain how you can use the find() method to query the MongoDB database. Write a simple code to demonstrate this.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `find()` method is used to query the MongoDB database and retrieve documents that match the specified criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Find documents where the address starts with the letter 'S'\n",
    "myquery = { \"address\": { \"$regex\": \"^S\" } }\n",
    "\n",
    "mydoc = mycol.find(myquery)\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in mydoc:\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Explain the sort() method. Give an example to demonstrate sorting in MongoDB.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The `sort()` method is used to sort the results of a query in MongoDB based on one or more fields in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sort the documents based on the name field in ascending order\n",
    "mydoc = mycol.find().sort(\"name\")\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in mydoc:\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sort the documents based on the name field in descending order\n",
    "mydoc = mycol.find().sort(\"name\", -1)\n",
    "\n",
    "for x in mydoc:\n",
    "  print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Explain why delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() is used.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_one()`: Used to delete a single document that matches the specified criteria from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `delete_many()`: Used to delete multiple documents that match the specified criteria from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `drop()`: Used to drop or delete the entire collection from the database. This operation permanently removes all documents and indexes associated with the collection."

    "Q1. **What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database:** A database is a structured collection of data organized in a way that it can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It serves as a repository for storing and retrieving data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:**\n",
    "  - SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with predefined schemas.\n",
    "  - They follow the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.\n",
    "  - Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Oracle.\n",
    "  - SQL databases use SQL for querying and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:**\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that do not require a fixed schema.\n",
    "  - They offer flexible data models and can handle large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "  - They provide horizontal scalability and high availability.\n",
    "  - Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase.\n",
    "  - NoSQL databases use various query languages and data models, such as document-oriented, key-value, column-oriented, and graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DDL (Data Definition Language):** DDL is a subset of SQL used to define and modify the structure of database objects such as tables, indexes, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **CREATE:** Used to create new database objects such as tables, views, indexes, etc.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "        id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "        name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "        salary FLOAT\n",
    "    );\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **DROP:** Used to delete existing database objects.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **ALTER:** Used to modify the structure of existing database objects.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **TRUNCATE:** Used to remove all records from a table, while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DML (Data Manipulation Language):** DML is a subset of SQL used to manipulate data stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **INSERT:** Used to insert new records into a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John', 50000);\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **UPDATE:** Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **DELETE:** Used to delete existing records from a table.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DQL (Data Query Language):** DQL is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **SELECT:** Used to retrieve data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.\n",
    "    ```sql\n",
    "    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key:** A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each record in the table. It must be unique and not null. Only one primary key can be defined for each table.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "      id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "      salary FLOAT\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Foreign Key:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship between two tables. It refers to the primary key of another table, known as the referenced table. It ensures referential integrity by enforcing a link between the data in the two tables.\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "      order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      customer_id INT,\n",
    "      FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(id)\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Write a Python code to connect MySQL to Python. Explain the cursor() and execute() method.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "# Establish connection\n",
    "mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"username\",\n",
    "    password=\"password\",\n",
    "    database=\"database_name\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create cursor object\n",
    "mycursor = mydb.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Execute SQL query\n",
    "mycursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetch result\n",
    "result = mycursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Process result\n",
    "for row in result:\n",
    "    print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Close cursor and connection\n",
    "mycursor.close()\n",
    "mydb.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **cursor():** The cursor() method creates a cursor object that allows Python code to interact with the MySQL database. It is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **execute():** The execute() method is used to execute SQL queries on the database. It takes an SQL query as a parameter and executes it. It can execute any SQL statement supported by MySQL, including DDL, DML, and DQL statements."

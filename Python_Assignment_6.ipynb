    "Q1. Creating a `Vehicle` class with an `__init__` method:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vehicle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name_of_vehicle, max_speed, average_of_vehicle):\n",
    "        self.name_of_vehicle = name_of_vehicle\n",
    "        self.max_speed = max_speed\n",
    "        self.average_of_vehicle = average_of_vehicle\n",

    "Q2. Creating a child class `Car` inheriting from the `Vehicle` class with a method `seating_capacity`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car(Vehicle):\n",
    "    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):\n",
    "        return f\"The {self.name_of_vehicle} has a seating capacity of {capacity} passengers.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "car = Car(\"Toyota\", 180, 25)\n",
    "print(car.seating_capacity(5))  # Output: The Toyota has a seating capacity of 5 passengers.\n",
    "```\n",

    "Q3. Multiple inheritance in Python occurs when a class is derived from more than one base class. This allows a derived class to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example demonstrating multiple inheritance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Base1:\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from Base1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Base2:\n",
    "    def method2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from Base2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class MultiDerived(Base1, Base2):\n",
    "    def method3(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from MultiDerived\")\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MultiDerived()\n",
    "obj.method1()  # Output: Method from Base1\n",
    "obj.method2()  # Output: Method from Base2\n",
    "obj.method3()  # Output: Method from MultiDerived\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Getter and setter methods in Python are used to get and set the values of private instance variables respectively. They allow controlled access to class attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a class with getter and setter methods:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self._value = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "    def get_value(self):\n",
    "        return self._value\n",
    "\n",
    "    def set_value(self, value):\n",
    "        self._value = value\n",
    "\n",
    "obj = MyClass()\n",
    "print(obj.get_value())  # Output: 0\n",
    "obj.set_value(10)\n",
    "print(obj.get_value())  # Output: 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Method overriding in Python occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example demonstrating method overriding:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent:\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Parent's show method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    def show(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Child's show method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "child.show()  # Output: Child's show method\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `show()` method in the `Child` class overrides the `show()` method in the `Parent` class. When you call `show()` on an instance of `Child`, it invokes the method defined in the `Child` class."

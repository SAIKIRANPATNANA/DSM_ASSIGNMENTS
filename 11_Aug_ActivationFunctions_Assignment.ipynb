    "**Q1. What is an activation function in the context of artificial neural networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: An activation function in artificial neural networks is a mathematical function that introduces non-linearity into the network. It is applied to the output of each neuron, determining whether it should be activated (\"fired\") or not, based on whether the neuron's input is relevant for the model's prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2. What are some common types of activation functions used in neural networks?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: Some common types of activation functions include:\n",
    "- Sigmoid (or Logistic)\n",
    "- Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)\n",
    "- Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n",
    "- Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (Leaky ReLU)\n",
    "- Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)\n",
    "- Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q3. How do activation functions affect the training process and performance of a neural network?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: Activation functions play a crucial role in neural networks by introducing non-linear properties. This non-linearity allows the network to learn from the error and make necessary corrections, which is essential for learning complex patterns. Without activation functions, neural networks would behave just like linear regression models and wouldn't be able to learn from non-linear data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q4. How does the sigmoid activation function work? What are its advantages and disadvantages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: \n",
    "- The sigmoid activation function outputs values between 0 and 1, which makes it especially useful for binary classification problems.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Smooth gradient, which prevents sudden jumps during training.\n",
    "- Clear predictions; for example, in binary classification (closer to 0 or 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- It can cause the vanishing gradient problem, which slows down the training.\n",
    "- Not zero-centered, potentially causing zig-zagging during training.\n",
    "- Computationally more expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q5. What is the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function? How does it differ from the sigmoid function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: ReLU is an activation function that outputs the input directly if it's positive; otherwise, it outputs zero. Mathematically, it's defined as \\(f(x) = max(0, x)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference from sigmoid:\n",
    "- ReLU is computationally more efficient since it only requires a simple thresholding at zero.\n",
    "- ReLU's output range is [0, infinity), whereas the sigmoid's range is (0,1).\n",
    "- ReLU can cause the dying ReLU problem, where neurons get stuck and don't activate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q6. What are the benefits of using the ReLU activation function over the sigmoid function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: \n",
    "- ReLU is computationally more efficient and allows the model to converge faster.\n",
    "- It avoids the vanishing gradient problem, which is commonly observed with sigmoid and tanh functions, especially in deep networks.\n",
    "- It has been observed empirically that ReLU tends to train deeper networks better than the sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q7. Explain the concept of \"leaky ReLU\" and how it addresses the vanishing gradient problem.**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: Leaky ReLU is a variant of ReLU where the function allows a small, non-zero gradient when the unit is not active (i.e., a small slope for negative values instead of flat zero). This helps in addressing the dying ReLU problem where neurons can sometimes get stuck during training and not activate at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q8. What is the purpose of the softmax activation function? When is it commonly used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: Softmax is an activation function that converts the output of a network into a probability distribution over multiple classes. The outputs sum up to 1, making it suitable for multi-class classification problems. It's commonly used in the output layer of a neural network when dealing with multi-class classification problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q9. What is the hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function? How does it compare to the sigmoid function?**\n",
    "\n",
    "*Answer*: \n",
    "- The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) is an activation function that outputs values between -1 and 1. It's essentially a scaled version of the sigmoid function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "- Like sigmoid, tanh also has a smooth gradient.\n",
    "- The range of tanh is [-1,1], making it zero-centered, which can make training faster and potentially lead to better convergence.\n",
    "- Similar to sigmoid, tanh can also face the vanishing gradient problem, especially in deep networks."

    "1. Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads concurrently. Each thread represents a separate flow of control within the same process. Multithreading is used to achieve parallelism, allowing tasks to run concurrently and utilize multiple CPU cores efficiently. The `threading` module is used to handle threads in Python. The `threading` module provides a high-level interface for creating and working with threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for using multithreading:\n",
    "- Improved performance: Multithreading allows programs to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, which can result in faster execution times, especially on multi-core processors.\n",
    "- Responsiveness: Multithreading can be used to create responsive user interfaces, as tasks that involve blocking operations (such as I/O operations) can be executed in separate threads without blocking the main thread.\n",
    "- Resource sharing: Threads can share data and resources within the same process, enabling efficient communication and collaboration between different parts of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for using the `threading` module:\n",
    "- The `threading` module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads, making it easier to work with threads in Python compared to low-level thread management.\n",
    "- It offers synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables to facilitate coordination and communication between threads.\n",
    "- The `threading` module abstracts away platform-specific details related to thread creation and management, providing a consistent API across different operating systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the functions:\n",
    "- `activeCount`: Returns the number of Thread objects currently alive. This includes the main thread and any other active threads.\n",
    "- `currentThread`: Returns the currently executing Thread object.\n",
    "- `enumerate`: Returns a list of all Thread objects currently alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explanation of thread-related functions:\n",
    "- `run`: Defines the entry point for the thread's activity. This method is called when the `start()` method of the thread is invoked.\n",
    "- `start`: Starts the thread's activity by calling the `run()` method. The thread will continue to run until its `run()` method returns or an exception occurs.\n",
    "- `join`: Waits for the thread to complete its execution. It blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates.\n",
    "- `isAlive`: Returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread is currently alive (i.e., actively executing its `run()` method).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Python program to create two threads printing squares and cubes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_squares():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Square of {i}: {i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_cubes():\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 6):\n",
    "        print(f\"Cube of {i}: {i*i*i}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create threads\n",
    "thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_squares)\n",
    "thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_cubes)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Start threads\n",
    "thread1.start()\n",
    "thread2.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Wait for threads to complete\n",
    "thread1.join()\n",
    "thread2.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Threads execution completed.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Advantages and disadvantages of multithreading:\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Improved performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores effectively.\n",
    "- Enhanced responsiveness in applications, especially in GUI-based programs.\n",
    "- Resource sharing and efficient communication between threads within the same process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- Complexity in synchronization and coordination between threads, leading to potential issues like race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "- Increased risk of bugs and errors due to concurrent execution of code.\n",
    "- Difficulty in debugging multithreaded programs compared to single-threaded ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Deadlocks occur when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources that they need to proceed. Deadlocks typically occur when threads acquire multiple locks in different orders and hold them while waiting for additional locks, resulting in a circular wait situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race conditions occur when the behavior of a program depends on the timing or interleaving of multiple threads. Race conditions can lead to unpredictable results or program crashes. They often occur when multiple threads access shared resources or variables concurrently without proper synchronization."

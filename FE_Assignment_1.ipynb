    "\n",
    "- Machine learning models may exhibit bias towards the majority class, leading to poor performance on minority classes.\n",
    "- The model's predictive accuracy may be misleading, as it may appear high due to accurately predicting the majority class while performing poorly on minority classes.\n",

    "\n",
    "When dealing with an imbalanced dataset in a medical diagnosis project, some strategies to evaluate the performance of machine learning models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Confusion Matrix Analysis**: Examine the confusion matrix to understand how the model performs in terms of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. This helps in assessing the model's ability to correctly classify both positive and negative cases, especially focusing on sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision-Recall Curve**: Plot the precision-recall curve and calculate the area under the curve (AUC-PR). This metric is particularly useful for imbalanced datasets as it provides insights into the trade-off between precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **F1 Score**: Calculate the F1 score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It considers both false positives and false negatives, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets where the positive class is underrepresented.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve**: Plot the ROC curve and calculate the area under the curve (AUC-ROC). While AUC-ROC is commonly used, it may not be ideal for highly imbalanced datasets as it can be misleading.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Resampling Techniques**: Utilize resampling techniques such as cross-validation, stratified sampling, or bootstrapping to ensure that the evaluation metrics are robust and representative of the dataset's imbalance.\n",

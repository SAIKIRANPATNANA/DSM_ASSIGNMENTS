    "Q1. Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):\n",
    "- Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes and behaviors that objects of the class will have.\n",
    "- Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has attributes (variables) and methods (functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, brand, model):\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "\n",
    "    def drive(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"{self.brand} {self.model} is being driven.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating objects of the Car class\n",
    "car1 = Car(\"Toyota\", \"Corolla\")\n",
    "car2 = Car(\"Honda\", \"Civic\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using object methods\n",
    "car1.drive()  # Output: Toyota Corolla is being driven.\n",
    "car2.drive()  # Output: Honda Civic is being driven.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Four pillars of OOPs:\n",
    "- Encapsulation\n",
    "- Abstraction\n",
    "- Inheritance\n",
    "- Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Use of the `__init__()` function:\n",
    "- The `__init__()` function is a special method in Python classes used for initializing objects.\n",
    "- It gets called automatically when a new object of the class is created.\n",
    "- It is used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an object of the Person class\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Alice\", 30)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(person1.name)  # Output: Alice\n",
    "print(person1.age)   # Output: 30\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Use of `self` in OOPs:\n",
    "- `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class.\n",
    "- It is used to access variables and methods of the current object within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Inheritance in OOPs:\n",
    "- Inheritance is a mechanism in OOPs that allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass).\n",
    "- It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example for each type of inheritance:\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Some sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def bark(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Woof\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.sound()  # Output: Some sound\n",
    "dog.bark()   # Output: Woof\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Parent1:\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from Parent1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent2:\n",
    "    def method2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from Parent2\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent1, Parent2):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "child.method1()  # Output: Method from Parent1\n",
    "child.method2()  # Output: Method from Parent2\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Grandparent:\n",
    "    def method1(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from Grandparent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Parent(Grandparent):\n",
    "    def method2(self):\n",
    "        print(\"Method from Parent\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Child(Parent):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "child = Child()\n",
    "child.method1()  # Output: Method from Grandparent\n",
    "child.method2()  # Output: Method from Parent\n",
    "```"

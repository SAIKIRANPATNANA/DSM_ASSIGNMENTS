    "Q1. The `open()` function is used to open a file in Python. Different modes for opening a file are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `r`: Opens the file in read-only mode. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- `w`: Opens the file in write-only mode. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length; otherwise, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "- `a`: Opens the file for appending new data. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for writing.\n",
    "- `r+`: Opens the file for both reading and writing. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- `w+`: Opens the file for both reading and writing. If the file exists, it truncates the file to zero length; otherwise, it creates a new file for reading and writing.\n",
    "- `a+`: Opens the file for reading and appending. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates a new file for reading and writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. The `close()` function is used to close a file. It is important to close a file to release the resources associated with it and to ensure that the data is written to the file properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Python program to create a text file, write data to it, and then read its content:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a text file and write data to it\n",
    "with open('sample.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('I want to become a Data Scientist')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Open the file and read its content\n",
    "with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)  # Output: I want to become a Data Scientist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explanation and demonstration of `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()` functions:\n",
    "- `read()`: Reads the entire content of the file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads a single line from the file and returns it as a string.\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all the lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings, each representing a single line.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Open the file in read mode\n",
    "with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    # Using read() to read entire content\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Using readline() to read single line\n",
    "    file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning\n",
    "    line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Using readlines() to read all lines\n",
    "    file.seek(0)  # Move the file pointer to the beginning\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    print(lines)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. The `with` statement is used with `open()` to ensure that the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised during the execution. The advantage of using `with` statement with `open()` is that it automatically handles closing the file, reducing the risk of resource leaks and making the code cleaner and more readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Explanation and example of `write()` and `writelines()` functions:\n",
    "- `write()`: Writes the specified string to the file.\n",
    "- `writelines()`: Writes a list of strings to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file using write() function\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, world!\\n')\n",
    "    file.write('This is a new line\\n')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing to a file using writelines() function\n",
    "lines = ['Line 1\\n', 'Line 2\\n', 'Line 3\\n']\n",
    "with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.writelines(lines)\n",
    "```"

    "Q1. **What is Flask Framework? What are the advantages of Flask Framework?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flask Framework:** Flask is a lightweight and flexible web application framework for Python. It provides tools and libraries for building web applications quickly and easily, with minimal boilerplate code. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 templating engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages of Flask Framework:**\n",
    "  1. Lightweight: Flask is minimalist and does not impose strict dependencies, making it lightweight and easy to learn.\n",
    "  2. Easy to use: Flask provides a simple and intuitive interface for building web applications, making development faster and more efficient.\n",
    "  3. Flexible: Flask allows developers to choose their preferred tools and libraries for various tasks, providing flexibility in application design.\n",
    "  4. Extensible: Flask is highly extensible and supports various extensions and plugins for adding additional functionality.\n",
    "  5. Well-documented: Flask has comprehensive documentation and a large community of users and contributors, making it easy to find help and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. **Create a simple Flask application to display ‘Hello World!!’.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def hello_world():\n",
    "    return 'Hello World!!'\n",

    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "    app.run(debug=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. **What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **App routing in Flask:** App routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URL routes to view functions or handlers within the application. It allows defining endpoints or routes that specify the URLs at which the application responds and the corresponding functions to handle the requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose of app routes:**\n",
    "  - App routes define the structure of the web application by mapping URLs to specific functionality or resources.\n",
    "  - They allow users to navigate through different parts of the application by specifying different routes.\n",
    "  - App routes provide a clean and organized way to manage the application's URL structure and handle different types of requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **Create a “/welcome” route to display the welcome message and a “/” route to show the company details.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/')\n",
    "def company_details():\n",
    "    return '''Company Name: ABC Corporation\n",
    "              Location: India\n",
    "              Contact Detail: 999-999-9999'''\n",
    "\n",
    "@app.route('/welcome')\n",
    "def welcome():\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **What function is used in Flask for URL Building? Write a Python code to demonstrate the working of the url_for() function.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **url_for() function:** The url_for() function in Flask is used for URL building. It generates a URL for the specified endpoint by referencing the route function's name. This allows for dynamic URL generation, making the application more flexible and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from flask import Flask, url_for\n",
    "\n",
    "app = Flask(__name__)\n",

    "**Q1: Difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ordinal Encoding**: In ordinal encoding, categorical variables are assigned numerical values based on their order or rank. For example, if we have size categories such as \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large,\" they might be encoded as 1, 2, and 3, respectively, indicating their relative sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Label Encoding**: In label encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer value. For example, if we have categories like \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" they might be encoded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively, without considering any inherent order or rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with the \"Education Level\" feature, which includes categories like \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD.\" If the education level has a clear order, such as increasing level of education, we would use ordinal encoding. However, if there's no inherent order among education levels, we would use label encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's proceed to Q2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q2: Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Guided Ordinal Encoding**: In this technique, categories of a categorical variable are encoded based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. It involves ordering the categories according to the target variable's mean or median and assigning ranks accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a dataset with a \"Salary\" feature and a target variable indicating whether a person has been promoted or not. We can use target guided ordinal encoding to encode the \"Department\" feature based on the mean salary of each department. Departments with higher mean salaries would be assigned higher ranks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is useful when there's a significant correlation between the categorical variable and the target variable, making it a good predictor of the target variable's outcome.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Q3: Covariance in Statistical Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together. It indicates the direction of the linear relationship between two variables. A positive covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other variable also tends to increase, while a negative covariance indicates that as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Importance**: Covariance is important in statistical analysis as it helps understand the relationship between variables. It is used to identify whether variables move together or in opposite directions, which is crucial for understanding patterns and making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Calculation**: The covariance between two variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "  \\[ \\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{n} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "  Where \\( \\bar{X} \\) and \\( \\bar{Y} \\) are the means of variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\), respectively, and \\( n \\) is the number of observations.\n",

    "**Q6: Encoding Technique Selection for Categorical Variables**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the given categorical variables in the animal dataset (\"Species,\" \"Habitat,\" and \"Diet\"), the encoding technique selection would depend on the nature of the variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Species**: If \"Species\" represents distinct categories with no inherent order or hierarchy, we would use one-hot encoding. Each species would be represented by a binary column indicating its presence or absence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Habitat**: If \"Habitat\" has ordinality or a natural order (e.g., forest < grassland < desert), we might use ordinal encoding to encode the habitats based on their relative rankings.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Diet**: If \"Diet\" has no ordinality and there's no specific hierarchy, we would also use one-hot encoding to represent each diet type as a binary column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification**:\n",
    "- One-hot encoding ensures that the model does not misinterpret ordinality or hierarchy that doesn't exist.\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding is suitable when there's a clear order or hierarchy among categories, and preserving this order is essential.\n",

    "**Q7: Encoding Categorical Data for Predicting Customer Churn**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the dataset containing features such as \"Gender,\" \"Education Level,\" and \"Employment Status,\" we would use the following encoding techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Gender (Binary Variable)**:\n",
    "   - Since \"Gender\" has only two categories (Male/Female), we can use binary encoding:\n",
    "     - Male: 0\n",
    "     - Female: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Education Level (Ordinal Variable)**:\n",
    "   - \"Education Level\" has a natural order (High School < Bachelor's < Master's < PhD). Hence, we can use ordinal encoding:\n",
    "     - High School: 1\n",
    "     - Bachelor's: 2\n",
    "     - Master's: 3\n",
    "     - PhD: 4\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Employment Status (Nominal Variable)**:\n",
    "   - Since \"Employment Status\" has no inherent order, we would use one-hot encoding:\n",
    "     - Unemployed: [1, 0, 0]\n",
    "     - Part-Time: [0, 1, 0]\n",
    "     - Full-Time: [0, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-Step Explanation**:\n",
    "1. For binary encoding of \"Gender,\" assign numerical values 0 and 1.\n",
    "2. For ordinal encoding of \"Education Level,\" assign numerical values based on the hierarchy.\n",
    "3. For one-hot encoding of \"Employment Status,\" create binary columns for each category, indicating the presence or absence of each status.\n",

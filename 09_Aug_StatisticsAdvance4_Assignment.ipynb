    "use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *t-test*: Used when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small. It is based on Student's t-distribution.\n",
    "- *z-test*: Used when the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large. It follows a normal distribution.\n",
    "  \n",
    "*Example Scenario*:\n",
    "- *t-test*: Comparing the mean scores of a new SAT coaching method when the population standard deviation is unknown and sample size is, say, 20 students.\n",
    "- *z-test*: Comparing the mean height of adult men from two different countries, where we have a large sample and know the population standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *One-tailed test*: Hypothesis test in which the values for which we're testing lie entirely in one tail of the distribution.\n",
    "- *Two-tailed test*: Tests for a difference in either direction, both left or right tail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for\n",
    "each type of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Type 1 (False Positive)*: Rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "  - Example: Declaring a drug effective when it's not.\n",
    "- *Type 2 (False Negative)*: Failing to reject a false null hypothesis.\n",
    "  - Example: Not identifying a disease in a patient when they do have it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "Bayes' theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: The probability of someone having a disease given a positive test result can be found using Bayes' theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "Interval estimate of a population parameter. The confidence level represents the frequency (i.e., the proportion) of possible confidence intervals that contain the true value of the unknown population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If we have a sample mean of 50 and standard error of 5, the 95% confidence interval is 50 ± (1.96*5), or 40 to 60.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6. Use Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge of the\n",
    "### event's probability and new evidence. Provide a sample problem and solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a rare disease affects 1 in 10,000 people, and a test that's 99% accurate (both for true positives and true negatives). If you test positive, what's the probability you have the disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive Test) = [P(Positive Test|Disease) * P(Disease)] / P(Positive Test)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution would involve plugging in the known probabilities and solving:\n",
    "P(Disease|Positive Test) = (0.99*1e-4)\n",

    "### Q7. Calculate the 95% confidence interval for a sample of data with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation\n",
    "### of 5. Interpret the results.\n",
    "For a normal distribution, the z-value for 95% confidence is 1.96.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval = Mean ± (Z-value * (Standard Deviation/sqrt(n)))\n",

    "Interval = 50 ± (1.96 * (5/sqrt(50))) = (48.61,51.38)\n",

    "### Q8. What is the margin of error in a confidence interval? How does sample size affect the margin of error?\n",
    "Provide an example of a scenario where a larger sample size would result in a smaller margin of error.\n",
    "It's half the width of the confidence interval. Smaller sample sizes lead to larger margins of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In political polling, a poll of 500 people might have a margin of error of 5%, but a poll of 2,000 people might have a margin of error of 2%.\n",
    "\n",

    "### significantly effective at a 95% confidence level using a t-test.\n",

    "### Q11. In a survey of 500 people, 65% reported being satisfied with their current job. Calculate the 95%\n",
    "### confidence interval for the true proportion of people who are satisfied with their job.\n",
    "With a sample proportion of 0.65, the margin of error for a 95% CI is:\n",
    "1.96 * sqrt((0.65*0.35)/500)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q12. A researcher is testing the effectiveness of two different teaching methods on student performance.\n",

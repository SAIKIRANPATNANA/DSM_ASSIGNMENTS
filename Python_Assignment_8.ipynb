    "Q1. What is an Exception in Python? Write the difference between Exceptions and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exception occurs, the Python interpreter raises an exception, which can be handled by the program to prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "- Exceptions occur during the execution of the program, while syntax errors occur during the parsing of code.\n",
    "- Exceptions are runtime errors, while syntax errors are detected before the program is executed.\n",
    "- Syntax errors indicate invalid Python syntax, while exceptions indicate unexpected behavior during the execution of valid Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. What happens when an exception is not handled? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an exception is not handled, it propagates up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program, which may result in the program terminating abnormally with an error message printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide(a, b):\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "\n",
    "# Division by zero exception is not handled\n",
    "result = divide(5, 0)\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 5, in <module>\n",
    "    result = divide(5, 0)\n",
    "  File \"example.py\", line 2, in divide\n",
    "    return a / b\n",
    "ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Which Python statements are used to catch and handle exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` statements are used to catch and handle exceptions in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This block will always execute.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Cannot divide by zero!\n",
    "This block will always execute.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Explain with an example: try, except, else, finally, raise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 2\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"Division successful!\")\n",
    "finally:\n",
    "    print(\"This block will always execute.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Custom exception raised conditionally\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "if x > 5:\n",
    "    raise ValueError(\"x should not be greater than 5.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. What are Custom Exceptions in Python? Why do we need Custom Exceptions? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom Exceptions, also known as user-defined exceptions, allow programmers to define their own exception classes to represent custom error conditions specific to their applications. We need custom exceptions to provide more meaningful error messages and to handle specific error cases in a more structured way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, message):\n",
    "        self.message = message\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f'CustomError: {self.message}'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage of custom exception\n",
    "def validate_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 18:\n",
    "        raise CustomError(\"Age must be 18 or above.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Age is valid.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    validate_age(15)\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Create a custom exception class. Use this class to handle an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomError(Exception):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    raise CustomError(\"Custom exception raised!\")\n",
    "except CustomError as e:\n",
    "    print(e)\n",
    "```"

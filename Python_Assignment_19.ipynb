    "Q4. **What is ‘DataFrame’ in pandas and how is it different from pandas.Series? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DataFrame:** DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure in pandas that can hold data of different types (e.g., numeric, string, boolean). It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table, where data is organized in rows and columns. Each column in a DataFrame is a pandas Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary\n",
    "  data = {'A': [1, 2, 3],\n",
    "          'B': ['a', 'b', 'c']}\n",
    "  df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "\n",
    "  # Printing the DataFrame\n",
    "  print(df)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Output:\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "     A  B\n",
    "  0  1  a\n",
    "  1  2  b\n",
    "  2  3  c\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In this example, `df` is a DataFrame with two columns labeled 'A' and 'B', where 'A' and 'B' are pandas Series containing integer and string data, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Difference:**\n",
    "  - A pandas Series is a one-dimensional array-like object that can hold data of a single data type, while a DataFrame is a two-dimensional structure that can hold data of multiple data types organized in rows and columns.\n",
    "  - A DataFrame can be thought of as a collection of pandas Series, where each column in the DataFrame is a Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. **What are some common functions you can use to manipulate data in a Pandas DataFrame? Can you give an example of when you might use one of these functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Common functions for DataFrame manipulation:**\n",
    "  - `head()`: Returns the first n rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "  - `tail()`: Returns the last n rows of the DataFrame.\n",
    "  - `info()`: Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including data types and missing values.\n",
    "  - `describe()`: Generates descriptive statistics for numerical columns.\n",
    "  - `loc[]` and `iloc[]`: Accesses rows and columns by label and index, respectively.\n",
    "  - `drop()`: Removes rows or columns from the DataFrame.\n",
    "  - `groupby()`: Groups data by one or more columns and performs aggregation operations.\n",
    "  - `merge()`: Combines multiple DataFrames based on common columns or indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example:**\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  # Using describe() function to generate descriptive statistics\n",
    "  print(df.describe())\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  This function can be used to quickly analyze the numerical data in a DataFrame, providing insights such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and quartile values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. **Which of the following is mutable in nature Series, DataFrame, Panel?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Among Series, DataFrame, and Panel, DataFrame is mutable in nature. This means that you can modify the contents of a DataFrame, including adding or removing rows and columns, updating values, and performing various data manipulation operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. **Create a DataFrame using multiple Series. Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating multiple Series\n",
    "name_series = pd.Series(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'])\n",
    "age_series = pd.Series([25, 30, 35])\n",
    "gender_series = pd.Series(['Female', 'Male', 'Male'])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a DataFrame using the Series\n",
    "df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': name_series, 'Age': age_series, 'Gender': gender_series})\n",
    "\n",
    "# Printing the DataFrame\n",
    "print(df)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create three pandas Series (`name_series`, `age_series`, and `gender_series`) containing data for the 'Name', 'Age', and 'Gender' columns, respectively. Then, we create a DataFrame `df` by passing these Series as values to a dictionary where the keys are the column names. Finally, we print the DataFrame, which consists of three columns ('Name', 'Age', and 'Gender') and three rows of data."

    "\n",
    "- `loc[]`: Access a group of rows and columns by labels.\n",
    "- `iloc[]`: Access a group of rows and columns by integer position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Reindex the given dataframe using a variable, reindex = [3,0,1,2] and store it in the variable, new_df then find the output for both new_df.loc[2] and new_df.iloc[2].\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "new_df = df.reindex([3, 0, 1, 2])\n",
    "print(new_df.loc[2])   # Access row with index label 2\n",

    "(i) mean of each and every column present in the dataframe.\n",
    "(ii) standard deviation of column, ‘column_2’\n",
    "\n",

    "Q5. Replace the data present in the second row of column, ‘column_2’ by a string variable then find the mean of column, column_2. If you are getting errors in executing it then explain why. [Hint: To replace the data use df1.loc[] and equate this to string data of your choice.]\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "# print(\"Mean of column 'column_2':\", mean_column_2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The error occurs because the column 'column_2' now contains both numeric and string values, and pandas cannot compute the mean of mixed data types.\n",

    "Q8. Write a Python program that takes in two dates as input (in the format YYYY-MM-DD) and calculates the difference between them in days, hours, and minutes using Pandas time delta. The program should prompt the user to enter the dates and display the result. Did you observe any difference in both the outputs? If so then explain it.\n",

    "print(\"Hours:\", hours)\n",
    "print(\"Minutes:\", minutes)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: The difference between the two outputs may vary because pandas considers the time component as well while calculating the time delta, whereas the above code calculates the difference only in terms of days, hours, and minutes.\n",

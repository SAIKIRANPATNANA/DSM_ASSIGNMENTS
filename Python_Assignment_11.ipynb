    "Q1. Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to create and manage multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs independently of the others and has its own memory space. Multiprocessing is useful for tasks that can be parallelized, allowing them to be executed simultaneously on multiple CPU cores. It enables efficient utilization of multicore CPUs and can lead to significant performance improvements for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Differences between multiprocessing and multithreading:\n",
    "- Multiprocessing involves running multiple processes concurrently, while multithreading involves running multiple threads within the same process.\n",
    "- Processes have separate memory spaces, while threads within the same process share memory.\n",
    "- Multiprocessing is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks, while multithreading is more suitable for I/O-bound tasks.\n",
    "- Multiprocessing takes advantage of multiple CPU cores, while multithreading is limited to a single CPU core due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python.\n",
    "- Multiprocessing has higher memory overhead compared to multithreading due to the separate memory space for each process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Python code to create a process using the multiprocessing module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    print(\"Worker process\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    p = multiprocessing.Process(target=worker)\n",
    "    p.start()\n",
    "    p.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. A multiprocessing pool in Python is a convenient way to distribute work across multiple processes. It allows you to create a pool of worker processes and submit tasks to the pool for execution. The pool manages the creation and termination of worker processes automatically. It is used to parallelize tasks that can be executed independently, improving the performance of CPU-bound operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Creating a pool of worker processes in Python using the multiprocessing module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker(num):\n",
    "    print(f\"Worker {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    # Create a pool of 4 worker processes\n",
    "    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=4) as pool:\n",
    "        # Submit tasks to the pool\n",
    "        pool.map(worker, range(4))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Python program to create 4 processes, each printing a different number using the multiprocessing module:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import multiprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "def print_number(num):\n",
    "    print(f\"Process {num}: {num}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    processes = []\n",
    "    for i in range(1, 5):\n",
    "        p = multiprocessing.Process(target=print_number, args=(i,))\n",
    "        processes.append(p)\n",
    "        p.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "    for p in processes:\n",
    "        p.join()\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this program, each process prints its assigned number from 1 to 4 using the `print_number` function. The `multiprocessing.Process` class is used to create each process, and the `start()` method is called to start each process. Finally, the `join()` method is called on each process to wait for all processes to complete their execution."
